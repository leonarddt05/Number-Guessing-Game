# Number Guessing Game in Java

A fun and interactive command-line game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. This project showcases core Java skills like loops, conditional logic, random number generation, and user input handling.

## 🎮 How to Play

The game will automatically generate a secret number between 1 and 100. Your goal is to guess this number in as few attempts as possible. The game provides feedback after each guess, telling you if your guess is "Too high!" or "Too low!". You have a limited number of attempts to find the number.

## ✨ Features

-   **Random Number Generation**: A new secret number is generated every time you play.
-   **Interactive Feedback**: Guides the player with "Too high" or "Too low" hints.
-   **Limited Attempts**: Adds a layer of challenge to the game.
-   **Input Validation**: Handles non-integer inputs gracefully.
-   **Score Tracking**: Displays the number of tries it took to guess correctly.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   **Java**: The core language for the game logic.
-   `java.util.Random`: For generating the secret number.
-   `java.util.Scanner`: For processing player input.
